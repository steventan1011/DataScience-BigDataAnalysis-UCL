## 1. UCL - Prediction on Beijing House Price   

**[R, Linear Regression, tree-based approaches, SVM]**

1.1 Crawled data from the Internet (URL: http://www.fang.com/) and imported the dataset into R  

1.2 Split the dataset into training and test datasets and used graphs to explore the variables suitable for predicting â–ª Compared the results of Decision Tree, Random Forest and Linear Regression to and used SVM to train the data  

1.3 Selected the optimal model (Random Forest) by cross-validation to predict the Beijing house price    

## 2. UCL - Credit Card Default Detection   

**[R Language, Logistic Regression, LOOCV]** 

2.1 Split the downloaded credit card default data into 70:15:15 training, dev and test sets randomly 

2.2 Explored the training data to investigate suitable variables for predicting loan default (balance, income, student)  

2.3 Performed a Logistic Regression fit to predict the probability of a customer defaulting based on his balance 

2.4 Manually performed LOOCV to find an unbiased estimate for misclassification rate on the training data 

2.5 Chose a set of suitable predictors and an optimal model for classifying the data set in order to help the bank reduce the fraction of customers who default
